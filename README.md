Predicting Car Price - A Machine Learning Model

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the prices of cars using machine learning techniques. The model leverages both statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, incorporating tools from the `statsmodels` and `sklearn` libraries to build, train, and evaluate various models for accurate price predictions.

Features

- Data Analysis: In-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify key predictors.
- Multiple Models: Linear regression models from `statsmodels` for interpretability and machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest) from `sklearn` for accuracy and performance comparison.
- Evaluation Metrics: R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate the models.

## Tools & Libraries

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
- statsmodels: To build and analyze statistical models like OLS regression.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn): For building machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and more.
- Jupyter Notebook: For development and interactive data exploration.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various features related to car attributes, including:

- Car brand
- Model
- Year of manufacture
- Mileage
- Engine size
- Fuel type
- Transmission type
- Car price (target variable)

Note: The dataset is pre-processed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding.

Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing data, outliers, and transforming categorical features.
   - Normalizing or standardizing the dataset if necessary.
   
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing key relationships between features and the target variable (car price).
   - Checking correlations between predictors.

3. Model Building:
   - **OLS Regression**: Using `statsmodels` to build a simple linear regression model for an intuitive understanding of how different features impact car prices.
   - **Machine Learning Models**: Using `sklearn` to build models like:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Tree Regressor
     - Random Forest Regressor
     - Ridge Regression

4. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluating models based on R-squared, MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
   - Comparing the performance of the statistical models (`statsmodels`) with machine learning models (`sklearn`).

5. Model Tuning:
   - Performing hyperparameter tuning on machine learning models using `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` for optimization.

6. Conclusion:
   - Identifying the most effective model based on performance metrics and interpreting key predictors for car price prediction.

Results

- Statsmodels OLS provided interpretability and insight into feature coefficients.
- **sklearn Random Forest Regressor** yielded the best performance in terms of prediction accuracy, significantly outperforming linear models.
  
Future Improvements
